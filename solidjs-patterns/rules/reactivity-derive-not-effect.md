## Derive State with Functions or Memos, Not Effects

**Impact: HIGH (unnecessary re-renders, potential infinite loops, and harder-to-trace data flow)**

When one value depends on another, derive it as a plain function or `createMemo` — never synchronize signals with `createEffect`. Effects are for side effects (DOM manipulation, logging, network requests), not for keeping state in sync.

**Incorrect (syncing state with an effect):**

```typescript
const [firstName, setFirstName] = createSignal("John");
const [lastName, setLastName] = createSignal("Doe");
const [fullName, setFullName] = createSignal("");

// BAD: effect creates a hidden data flow, extra signal, extra re-render
createEffect(() => {
  setFullName(`${firstName()} ${lastName()}`);
});
```

**Correct (cheap derivation — plain function):**

```typescript
const [firstName, setFirstName] = createSignal("John");
const [lastName, setLastName] = createSignal("Doe");

// GOOD: plain function — zero overhead, recalculates when called in tracked scope
const fullName = () => `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`;
```

**Correct (expensive derivation — createMemo):**

```typescript
const [items, setItems] = createSignal<Item[]>([]);
const [filter, setFilter] = createSignal("");

// GOOD: createMemo caches result, only recomputes when dependencies change
const filteredItems = createMemo(() => items().filter((item) => item.name.includes(filter())));
```

**When to use which:**

| Scenario                                    | Use                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Simple property access, string concat, math | Plain function `() => ...` |
| Filtering, sorting, mapping large arrays    | `createMemo`               |
| Side effects (fetch, DOM, logging)          | `createEffect`             |

**Notes:**

- Plain functions in SolidJS are naturally reactive when called inside JSX or effects — they re-evaluate when their signal dependencies change
- `createMemo` adds caching — use it when the computation is expensive or accessed in multiple places
- If you find yourself writing `createEffect(() => setX(...))`, it's almost always a sign you should use a derived function or memo instead
