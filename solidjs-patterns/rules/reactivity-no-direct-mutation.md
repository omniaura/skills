## Never Mutate Store Values Directly

**Impact: CRITICAL (mutations silently ignored — UI doesn't update)**

Store proxies track reads and writes through the setter function. Direct mutation bypasses the proxy and triggers nothing.

**Incorrect (direct mutation — no update triggered):**

```typescript
const [state, setState] = createStore({ items: [] });

state.items.push(newItem); // Won't trigger reactivity!
```

**Correct (use setter or produce):**

```typescript
// Path-based setter
setState("items", (items) => [...items, newItem]);

// Or produce for complex mutations
import { produce } from "solid-js/store";

setState(
  produce((state) => {
    state.items.push(newItem);
    state.count++;
  }),
);
```
